# planr
### Team 
+ Landon Baxter (laba2346)  
+ Michael Catchen (gottacatchenall) 
+ Darwin Boersma (ogghead) 
+ Josef Los (jlos842)  

A webapp that manages assignments for students. The application is designed to make adding assignments quick and easy. Students can also add classes and associate new assignments with classes. Students also can get a calendar view to get a broad sense of when items are due. Planr is fully customizable and designed to suit to aesthetic preferences. 

### Vision
User friendly task manager that students will actually use.

### Motivation 
We are a group of students that are discontent with the current market for task manager apps. None of them cater to students enough.

### Risks
+ ReactJS & redux are frameworks that 3/4 group members are unfamiliar with
+ Schedule conflicts
+ Potentially unoriginal (maybe)

### Mitigation 
+ Spending free time on codecademy and other websites to learn JS
+ Create a schedule that is known to work
+ We're improving upon an idea that already exists

### Requirements

1. As a student, I want to be able to organize my assignments by class so I never miss an assignment (3 hours)   
2. As a student, I want to be able to quickly and easily create tasks so that I can focus on lecture (4 hours)  
3. As a group of pals, we want to be able to share the same assignment so that we can collaborate better (6 hours)  
4. As a student, I want to be reminded of my assignments so I don't forget to complete them (3 hours)  
5. As a student, I want to have class information readily available so I don't have to check the syllabus all the time (3 hours)      
6. As a student, I want to be able to check my pals' availability so that we can more easily plan study sessions (7 hours)    
  
### Methodology

We are going to apply Agile for this project.
