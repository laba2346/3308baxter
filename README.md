A webapp that manages assignments for students

### Vision
Task manager that you will actually use.
User friendly task manager for students

### Motivation 
We are a group of students that are discontent with the current market for task manager apps. None of them cater to students enough.

### Risks
+ ReactJS & redux are frameworks that 3/4 group members are unfamiliar with
+ Schedule conflicts
+ Potentially unoriginal (maybe)

### Mitigation 
+ Spending free time codecademy and other websites to learn JS
+ Create a schedule that is known to work
+ We're improving upon an idea that already exists

### Requirements

1. As a student, I want to be able to organize my assignments by class so I never miss an assignment (3 hours)   
2. As a student, I want to be able to quickly and easily create tasks so that I can focus on lecture (4 hours)  
3. As a group of pals, we want to be able to share the same assignment/ so that we can collaborate better (6 hours)  
4. As a student, I want to be reminded of my assignments so I don't forget to complete them (3 hours)  
5. As a student, I want to have class information readily available so I don't have to check the syllabus all the time (3 hours)      
6. As a student, I want to be able to check my pals' availability so that we can more easily plan study sessions (7 hours)    
  
### Methodology

We are going to apply Agile for this project.
